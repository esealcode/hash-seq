Thereupon something catches my attention, either deeply or not, whereas the knowledge of it can be heavily leveraged or not, I feel this extraordinarily and absolutely delightful feeling or wanting to know more. Notably things that relates to sciences, unless they're boring but that's highly unlikely most of the time. Hence, I end up radically switching from one thing to another as long as it pleases my brain.

Exceedingly doing that is probably not the best way of approaching the subjects although that's how curiosity works. You do not need to be exceptionally curious or immensely smart to know this feeling, it happens to most of us as our brains undoubtedly crave for stimulation this days.

Then, after thoroughly investigating the subject you find yourself heavily talking about it around you which is probably significantly annoying to most people, but that's what happens when you care deeply about a subject.

Albeit all of the above is true, it is blatantly verbose so I'll try to make my point in a more straightforward manner from now on, especially for our younger generations that cannot read more than one paragraph without losing it, this is undoubtedly not a joke, or is it? We'll never know.
